# Trying to Replicate the ECG

My Github is looking a bit sparse, so I thought I would upload some of the projects I have been doing in my spare time. The first is my attempt to replicate the ECG using a model of electrical activity in the heart.

Stages:

1. Create a data structure to represent the heart which can be used efficiently to be updated and 
2. Create code to propogate the heart beat
